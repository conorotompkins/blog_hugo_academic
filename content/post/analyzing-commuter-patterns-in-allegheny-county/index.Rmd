###

In this post I will use networks plots to analyze patterns of commuters in Allegheny County. I use the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) [dataset](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. This dataset contains summarized and anonymized estimate data regarding where people live and work. I use this data to map where Allegheny County residents live and work.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

In my analysis I use many of the standard tidyverse packages, sf, tidygraph, and ggraph.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tigris)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

The first step is to read in the geographies crosswalk and the census tract geographies.
```{r}
geo_crosswalk <- read_csv("data/pa_xwalk.csv.gz", col_types = cols(.default = "c"))

allegheny_tracts <- get_decennial(geography = "tract",
                           variables = c(total_pop = "P001001"),
                           state = "PA",
                           county = "Allegheny County",
                           geometry = TRUE,
                           output = "wide")

st_erase <- function(x, y) {
  st_difference(x, st_union(st_combine(y)))
}

rivers <- area_water("PA", "Allegheny", class = "sf")
```

This shows the outlines of the tracts used in the analysis.
```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_sf()
```

The crosswalk file contains keys to join a variety of geographies.
```{r}
geo_crosswalk
```

Next I read in the main LODES data. This is a big file, so it takes a moment.
```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/pa_od_main_JT00_2015.csv.gz", col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>% 
  mutate(S000 = as.numeric(S000)) %>% 
  select(h_geocode, w_geocode, S000)

df
```

Next I summarize the number of commuters per home-work tract combination. The original file uses census block codes, which are too granular for this analysis. I link the blocks to census tracts and aggregate to that level.
```{r}
df_tracts_summarized <- df %>% 
  group_by(h_geocode, w_geocode) %>% 
  summarize(commuters = sum(S000)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(commuters))

df_tracts_summarized <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  left_join(geo_crosswalk %>% select(tabblk2010, trct), by = c("h_geocode" = "tabblk2010")) %>% 
  rename(h_tract = trct) %>% 
  left_join(geo_crosswalk %>% select(tabblk2010, trct), by = c("w_geocode" = "tabblk2010")) %>% 
  rename(w_tract = trct)

df_tracts_summarized <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  group_by(h_tract, w_tract) %>% 
  summarize(commuters = sum(commuters)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(commuters))

df_tracts_summarized <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  semi_join(allegheny_tracts, by = c("h_tract" = "GEOID")) %>% 
  semi_join(allegheny_tracts, by = c("w_tract" = "GEOID"))
```

This code removes rows where the commuter lives and works in the same tract.
```{r}
df_tracts_summarized <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  arrange(h_tract) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  filter(!(h_tract == w_tract))
```

This code finds the center of each tract, which I use as the nodes in the network plots.
```{r}
allegheny_tracts <- allegheny_tracts %>% 
  arrange(GEOID)

allegheny_tracts_centroids <- cbind(allegheny_tracts,
                                    st_coordinates(st_centroid(allegheny_tracts))) %>% 
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(x = X,
         y = Y) %>% 
  select(GEOID, x, y)
```

This shows that the centroids correctly appear in the center of each tract.
```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_point(data = allegheny_tracts_centroids, aes(x, y), size = .2)
```

## EDA

First, I do some exploratory analysis of the number of commuters in/out per tract. Since we cannot join the census geography dataframe to the LODES data directly, I reverse engineer the process by splitting the data into separate "home" and "work" dataframes, and then joining the census geography dataframe to those dataframes.
```{r}
df_home <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  rename(tract = h_tract,
         commuters_out = commuters) %>% 
  select(-w_tract) %>% 
  group_by(tract) %>% 
  summarize(commuters_out = sum(commuters_out))

df_work <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  rename(tract = w_tract,
         commuters_in = commuters) %>% 
  select(-h_tract) %>% 
  group_by(tract) %>% 
  summarize(commuters_in = sum(commuters_in))
```

This checks that there are no duplicate tracts in either dataframe:
```{r}
df_home %>% 
  count(tract, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

df_home %>% 
  count(tract, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

This joins the separate dataframes back to the census geography dataframe:
```{r}
allegheny_tracts <- allegheny_tracts %>% 
  left_join(df_home, by = c("GEOID" = "tract")) %>% 
  left_join(df_work, by = c("GEOID" = "tract")) %>% 
  replace_na(list(commuters_in = 0))
```

The tract with many more commuters "in" is downtown Pittsburgh.
```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(commuters_out, commuters_in, label = NAME)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = commuters_in), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_graph()
```

This shows which tracts have the most outflow of commuters:
```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = commuters_out), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_graph()
```

The outflow of commuters tracks with the population of the tract, with some exceptions.
```{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(commuters_out, total_pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

Downtown Pittsburgh dominates in terms of inflow vs. outflow differential.
````{r}
allegheny_tracts %>% 
  mutate(diff = commuters_in - commuters_out) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = diff), color = NA) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Commuters in minus commuters out", direction = 1) +
    theme_graph()
```

## Set up main graph
With the exploratory analysis done, I move on to the main task of making a geographic network plot where the nodes are the center of each census tract.

First, I set a minimum threshhold for the number of commuters flowing between two tracts. Then, I transform the `df_tracts_summarized` data into a `tbl_graph` object, which lets it be used for network analysis.
```{r}
minimum_commuters <- 100

g <- df_tracts_summarized %>% 
  as_tbl_graph(directed = TRUE)

g
```
The result is a list of two dataframes; one for the nodes, one for the edges.

This filters out the edges that do not meet the minimum threshhold.
```{r}
g_main <- g %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(commuters > minimum_commuters)

g_main
```

This shows the edges with the most commuters:
```{r}
g_main %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  arrange(desc(commuters))
```

This code sets the nodes for the graph at the center of each census tract and creates a manual layout that the network plot will use.
```{r}
node_pos <- allegheny_tracts_centroids

manual_layout <- create_layout(graph = g_main,
                               layout = node_pos)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
manual_layout %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Finally, this sets the parameters for the plot and makes the network graph:
```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
legend_title <- str_c("Minimum: ", minimum_commuters, " commuters")

ggraph(manual_layout) +
  geom_sf(data = allegheny_tracts, color = "dark grey", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = rivers, fill = "white", color = NA, alpha = .5) +
  geom_node_point(alpha = 0) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(edge_width = commuters, 
                    edge_alpha = commuters),
                arrow = arrow(length = unit(.5, 'lines')), 
                start_cap = circle(.1, 'lines'),
                end_cap = circle(.2, 'lines'),
                color = "white",
                strength = .5) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, 1.5)) +
  scale_edge_alpha_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, .8)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Where do people commute from/to for work?",
       subtitle = "Excludes within-tract commuters",
       caption = "Based on 2015 US Census LODES dataset | @conor_tompkins") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "light grey"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
```

Clearly downtown Pittsburgh attracts the most commuters. This is not surprising, but it obscures other job centers that attract employees.

## Set up graph without downtown tract

This code filters out commuters that work downtown. Again, set a threshhold and filter on it.
```{r}
minimum_commuters <- 100

g_filtered <- g %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(commuters > minimum_commuters)

g_filtered
```

This code goes into the network data and excludes edges that connect to the downtown tract.
```{r}
filter_tract <- "42003020100"

selected_node <- manual_layout %>% 
  filter(name != filter_tract) %>% 
  pull(.ggraph.orig_index)

g_filtered <- g_filtered %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(to %in% selected_node)

g_filtered
```

This creates another layout for this plot:
```{r}
manual_layout_filtered <- create_layout(graph = g_filtered,
                                        layout = node_pos)
```

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
legend_title <- str_c("Minimum: ", minimum_commuters, " commuters")

ggraph(manual_layout_filtered) +
  geom_sf(data = allegheny_tracts, size = .1, fill = NA, color = "dark grey") +
  geom_sf(data = rivers, fill = "white", color = NA, alpha = .5) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(edge_width = commuters, edge_alpha = commuters
            ),
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.5, 'lines')),
            start_cap = circle(.1, 'lines'),
            end_cap = circle(.2, 'lines'),
            color = "white",
            strength = .5) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, 1.5)) +
  scale_edge_alpha_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, .8)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Where do people commute from/to for work?",
       subtitle = "Excludes within-tract commuters and commuters to downtown tract",
       caption = "Based on 2015 US Census LODES dataset | @conor_tompkins") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "light grey"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
```

## Set up facted graphs

This code creates a faceted plot that focuses on the top 5 tracts in terms of commuter outflow:
```{r}
minimum_commuters <- 5

top_work_tracts <- df_home %>% 
  arrange(desc(commuters_out)) %>% 
  top_n(5, commuters_out) %>% 
  select(tract)

g_facet <- g %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  left_join(manual_layout %>% select(.ggraph.index, name), by = c("from" = ".ggraph.index")) %>% 
  semi_join(top_work_tracts, by = c("name" = "tract")) %>% 
  filter(commuters > minimum_commuters)

g_facet %>% 
  arrange(desc(commuters)) %>% 
  activate(edges)
```
```{r}
manual_layout_faceted <- create_layout(graph = g_facet,
                                        layout = node_pos)
manual_layout_faceted %>% 
  as_tibble()
```
```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
legend_title <- str_c("Minimum: ", minimum_commuters, " commuters")

ggraph(manual_layout_faceted) +
  geom_sf(data = allegheny_tracts, size = .1, fill = NA, color = "dark grey") +
  geom_sf(data = rivers, fill = "white", color = NA, alpha = .5) +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(edge_width = commuters, edge_alpha = commuters),
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(.5, 'lines')),
            start_cap = circle(.1, 'lines'),
            end_cap = circle(.2, 'lines'),
            color = "red",
            strength = .5) +
  facet_edges(~name) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, 1.5)) +
  scale_edge_alpha_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, 1)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Where do people commute from/to for work?",
       subtitle = "Not including within-tract commuters",
       caption = "Based on 2015 US Census LODES dataset | @conor_tompkins") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "light grey"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
```

## Zoom in on one tract
There also may be tracts of interest outside of the main commuter inflow/outflow tracts. This code creates a framework for filtering on commuters from a selected tract and zooming in on that tract.

Set the threshhold and filter:
```{r}
minimum_commuters <- 15

g_filtered <- g %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(commuters > minimum_commuters)

g_filtered
```

This code gets the commuter outflow data for one tract and creates `allegheny_tracts_highlight`, which will be used to highlight the tract of interest.
```{r}
filter_tract <- "42003473500"

allegheny_tracts_highlight <- allegheny_tracts %>% 
  semi_join(df_tracts_summarized %>% 
              filter(h_tract == filter_tract), by = c("GEOID" = "w_tract")) %>% 
  filter(commuters_in > minimum_commuters)

allegheny_tracts_highlight

selected_node <- manual_layout %>% 
  filter(name == filter_tract) %>% 
  pull(.ggraph.orig_index)

g_filtered <- g_filtered %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(from == selected_node)

g_filtered
```

Set the layout for the graph:
```{r}
manual_layout_filtered <- create_layout(graph = g_filtered,
                                        layout = node_pos)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
manual_layout_filtered %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

This will be used to zoom in on the selected tract:
```{r}
zoom_x <- manual_layout_filtered %>% 
  filter(.ggraph.orig_index == selected_node) %>% 
  pull(x)

zoom_y <- manual_layout_filtered %>% 
  filter(.ggraph.orig_index == selected_node) %>% 
  pull(y)

zoom_magnitude <- .25
```

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
legend_title <- str_c("Minimum: ", minimum_commuters, " commuters")

ggraph(manual_layout_filtered) +
  geom_sf(data = allegheny_tracts, size = .1, fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = rivers, fill = "white", color = NA, alpha = .5) +
  geom_sf(data = allegheny_tracts %>%  filter(GEOID == filter_tract), 
          fill = "grey") +
  geom_edge_fan(aes(edge_width = commuters),
                arrow = arrow(length = unit(.5, 'lines')),
                start_cap = circle(.1, 'lines'),
                end_cap = circle(.2, 'lines'),
                color = "red",
                strength = .5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(zoom_x - zoom_magnitude, zoom_x + zoom_magnitude), 
           ylim = c(zoom_y - zoom_magnitude, zoom_y + zoom_magnitude)) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, 1.5)) +
  scale_edge_alpha_continuous(legend_title, range = c(.1, .8)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Where do people commute from/to for work?",
       subtitle = str_c("From tract", filter_tract, sep = " "),
       caption = "Based on 2015 US Census LODES dataset | @conor_tompkins") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "light grey"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
```
