Euclidean distance is a simple way to measure the distance between two points. It can also be used to measure how similar two sports teams are, given a set of variables. In this post, I use Euclidean distance to calculate the similarity between USL clubs and map that data to a network graph. I will use the [538 Soccer Power Index data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/global-club-soccer-rankings/) to calculate the distance. 

## Setup
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
library(viridis)

set_graph_style()

set.seed(1234)
```

## Download data
This code downloads the data from 538's GitHub repo and does some light munging.
```{r}
read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_global_rankings.csv", progress = FALSE) %>% 
  filter(league == "United Soccer League") %>% 
  mutate(name = str_replace(name, "Arizona United", "Phoenix Rising")) -> df

df
```

## Calculate Euclidean distance
This is the code that measures the distance between the clubs. It uses the 538 offensive and defensive ratings.
```{r}
df %>% 
  select(name, off, def) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "name") -> df_dist

#df_dist
#rownames(df_dist) %>% 
#  head()

df_dist <- dist(df_dist, "euclidean", upper = FALSE, diag = FALSE)
#head(df_dist)

df_dist %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance)) -> df_dist

#df_dist %>% 
#  count(item1, sort = TRUE) %>% 
#  ggplot(aes(item1, n)) +
#  geom_point() +
#  coord_flip() +
#  theme_bw()
```

## Network graph
In this snippet I set a threshhold for how similar clubs need to be to warrant a connection. Then I graph it using tidygraph and ggraph. Teams that are closer together on the graph are more similar. Darker and thicker lines indicate higher similarity.
```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
distance_filter <- .5

df_dist %>% 
  mutate(distance = distance^2) %>% 
  filter(distance <= distance_filter) %>%
  as_tbl_graph(directed = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness())) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk", maxiter = 1000) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(edge_alpha = distance, edge_width = distance)) + 
    geom_node_label(aes(label = name, color = community), size = 5) +
    scale_color_discrete("Group") +
    scale_edge_alpha_continuous("Euclidean distance ^2", range = c(.2, 0)) +
    scale_edge_width_continuous("Euclidean distance ^2", range = c(2, 0)) +
    labs(title = "United Soccer League clubs",
       subtitle = "Euclidean distance (offensive rating, defensive rating)^2",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       caption = "538 data, @conor_tompkins")
