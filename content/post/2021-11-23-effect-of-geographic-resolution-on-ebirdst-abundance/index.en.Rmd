While exploring some of the citizen science bird observation data available through [`ebirdst`](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebirdst/), I was confused by how to understand the calculation of `ebirdst`'s `abundance` metric.

The `ebirdst` documentation (`?ebirdst::load_raster`) defines `abundance` as:

>the expected relative abundance, computed as the product of the probability of occurrence and the count conditional on occurrence, of the species on an eBird Traveling Count by a skilled eBirder starting at the optimal time of day with the optimal search duration and distance that maximizes detection of that species in a region.

I had seen some weird results when trying to manually calculate `abundance` as `occurrence * count`. My initial attempt had aggregated the results by month.

The underlying problem is that `abundance` and `count` are the results of models, and are subject to model error. I also believe that the data outputted from `load_raster` lacks the necessary significant digits to accurately recreate `abundance`. Lowering the resolution or aggregating the data will exacerbate this issue.

This code loads my [convenience function](https://github.com/conorotompkins/ebird_shiny_app/blob/main/scripts/functions/pull_species_metric.R) to retrieve a metric for a species at a given geographic resolution. This gets `occurrence`, `count`, and `abundance` for the Northern Cardinal at high (3 km), medium (9 km), and low resolutions (27 km). The function also crops the underlying raster data to Allegheny County, PA.
```{r}
library(here)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(patchwork)

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conorotompkins/ebird_shiny_app/main/scripts/functions/pull_species_metric.R")

theme_set(theme_ipsum())

species_table <- crossing(species = c("Northern Cardinal"),
                          metric = c("occurrence", "count", "abundance"),
                          resolution = c("hr", "mr", "lr"))

species_table
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
species_metrics <- species_table %>% 
  mutate(data = pmap(list(species, metric, resolution), ~get_species_metric(..1, ..2, ..3))) %>% 
  mutate(resolution = fct_relevel(resolution, c("hr", "mr", "lr"))) %>% 
  arrange(species, metric, resolution)

species_metrics
```

This unnests the data and recalculates abundance (`abundance_test`) and the difference between actual `abundance` and `abundance_test`.
```{r}
species_table_unnested <- species_metrics %>%
  unnest(data) %>% 
  select(species, resolution, date, month, x, y, metric_desc, value) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(species, resolution, date, month, x, y),
              names_from = metric_desc,
              values_from = value) %>% 
  select(species, resolution, date, month, x, y, count, occurrence, abundance) %>% 
  mutate(abundance_test = count * occurrence,
         diff = abundance - abundance_test)
```

Grouping by month to get to the county level changes the grain of the data so much that `abundance_test` undershoots `abundance` by 20%. This occurs at all resolutions.
```{r}
species_metrics %>%
  unnest(data) %>% 
  select(species, resolution, date, month, x, y, metric_desc, value) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(species, resolution, date, month, x, y),
              names_from = metric_desc,
              values_from = value) %>% 
  select(species, resolution, date, month, x, y, count, occurrence, abundance) %>% 
  group_by(species, month, resolution) %>% 
  summarize(occurrence = mean(occurrence, na.rm = T),
            count = mean(count, na.rm = T),
            abundance = mean(abundance, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(abundance_test = count * occurrence,
         diff = abundance - abundance_test) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(abundance, abundance_test)) +
  geom_abline() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~resolution) +
  tune::coord_obs_pred()
```

Totally un-aggregated, `abundance_test` closely resembles `abundance`, but degrades as resolution decreases.
```{r}
species_table_unnested %>% 
  select(abundance, abundance_test, resolution) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(abundance, abundance_test)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(contour_var = "ndensity") +
  facet_wrap(~resolution) +
  tune::coord_obs_pred() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 8),
                  ylim = c(0, 8)) +
  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps())
```

At lower resolutions, the difference is positively skewed, which means that `abundance` is higher than `abundance_test.`
```{r}
species_table_unnested %>% 
  drop_na(diff) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(diff)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~resolution, scale = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

At the highest resolution, `diff` is heteroskedastic. At lower resolutions, there are patterns to the error. When `occurrence` is between 50% and 90%, `diff` is again skewed positively.
```{r}
species_table_unnested %>% 
  drop_na(occurrence, diff) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(occurrence, diff)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(contour_var = "ndensity") +
  facet_wrap(~resolution) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-.2, .2)) +
  scale_x_percent() +
  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps())
```

This was a useful exercise for me to understand how the geographic resolution and other aggregation of the data can affect estimated metrics, specifically in the citizen science context.

## Update

I made an issue on the [ebirdst](https://github.com/CornellLabofOrnithology/ebirdst/issues/33) Github page and talked to one of the maintainers about their definitions of count and abundance. I now have a much stronger understanding of these variables.

The following code reproduces the graph I attached to the issue:
```{r}
library(hrbrthemes)
theme_set(theme_ipsum())

norcar_table <- crossing(species = c("Northern Cardinal"),
                          metric = c("occurrence", "count", "abundance"),
                          resolution = c("hr"))

norcar_metrics <- norcar_table %>% 
  mutate(data = pmap(list(species, metric, resolution), ~get_species_metric(..1, ..2, ..3))) %>% 
  mutate(resolution = fct_relevel(resolution, c("hr", "mr", "lr"))) %>% 
  arrange(species, metric, resolution)

norcar_metrics_unnested <- norcar_metrics %>%
  unnest(data)

norcar_metrics_wide <- norcar_metrics_unnested %>% 
  select(species, date, x, y, metric_desc, value) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(species, date, x, y, metric_desc),
              names_from = metric_desc,
              values_from = value)

plot_1 <- norcar_metrics_wide %>% 
  drop_na(occurrence, count) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(occurrence, count)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(contour_var = "ndensity") +
  scale_x_percent() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme_bw()

plot_2 <- norcar_metrics_wide %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(occurrence, abundance)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(contour_var = "ndensity") +
  scale_x_percent() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme_bw()

plot_3 <- norcar_metrics_wide %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(count, abundance)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(contour_var = "ndensity") +
  geom_abline() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 12),
                  ylim = c(0, 12)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme_bw()

layout <- "
AACC
BBCC
"
plot_1 + plot_2 + plot_3 + 
  plot_layout(guides = 'collect', design = layout) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Northern Cardinal in Allegheny County Pennsylvania")

```
