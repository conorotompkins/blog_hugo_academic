This post is about predicting demand for the Healthy Ride bike system in Pittsburgh. I wanted to try out Facebook's `prophet` package and try to do some time series forecasting.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

As usual, load the required packages and set up the environment:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(prophet)
library(janitor)
library(hrbrthemes)

options(scipen = 999)

theme_set(theme_bw())
```

This code loads the data and formats the date column so the `prophet` package can interface with it. I use `dir()` to find all the CSV files in  the folder and then `set_names()` and `map_df(read_csv())` to read each of the CSV files into memory.
```{r}
files <- dir("data", ".csv")

data <- str_c("data/", files) %>% 
  set_names() %>% 
  map_df(read_csv) %>% 
  clean_names()

df <- data %>% 
  filter(date < "2019-08-01") %>% 
  count(date)

# df %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(date, n)) +
#   geom_point()
# 
# last(df$date)
```

The data I will use contains the number of rides per day and also includes the month and year. `prophet` will identify the time series patterns ("seasonality") in the data and identify the "true" pattern

`prophet` has a plug-and-play workflow that is easy to use, but it has more stringent requirements for how the data has to be shaped. The date data has to be named `ds` and the target variable has to be named `y`. I set the floor to zero because there cannot be fewer than 0 rides in a day. `prophet` requires a cap
```{r}
max_rides <- df %>% 
  summarize(max_rides = max(n) * 3) %>% 
  pull()

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(n = log(n),
         cap = log(max_rides)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% 
  rename(ds = date,
         y = n) %>% 
  mutate(floor = 0)



df %>% 
  filter(is.na(ds))
```

```{r}
glimpse(df)
```

This creates the set of holidays I use in the model.
```{r}
us_holidays <- prophet::generated_holidays %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  filter(country == "US") %>% 
  mutate(ds = as.Date(ds))
```

This code fits a model to the dataset.
```{r}
m <- prophet(df, growth = 'logistic', holidays = us_holidays)
```

`make_future_dataframe()` creates the dataframe that `prophet` uses to make its forecast. In this case, I have it create a dataframe with 365 days of additional rows to predict onto.
```{r}
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 365, freq = "day") %>% 
  mutate(floor = 0,
         cap = unique(df$cap))
```

This code performs the forecast on the future dataset.
```{r}
forecast <- predict(m, future) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

The output is a dataframe with the date, the predicted ridership, and the upper and lower bounds of the prediction.
```{r}
forecast
```

`plot` automatically plots the `forecast` data:
```{r}
plot(m, forecast)
```

`prophet` also decomposes the various seasonal effects.
```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```

We can of course use `ggplot` to manually plot the data.
```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
df_aug <- forecast %>% 
  mutate(ds = ymd(ds)) %>% 
  left_join(df) %>% 
  mutate(yhat = exp(yhat),
         yhat_lower = exp(yhat_lower),
         yhat_upper = exp(yhat_upper),
         y = exp(y))

df_aug %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ds)) +
    geom_ribbon(data = df_aug %>% filter(ds > last(df$ds)), 
                aes(ymin = yhat_lower, ymax = yhat_upper), alpha = .2, fill = "blue") +
    geom_line(data = df_aug %>% filter(ds > last(df$ds)), 
              aes(y = yhat), color = "blue") +
    geom_point(aes(y = y), alpha = .5) +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = unique(floor)), linetype = 2) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = "Number of rides") +
    scale_y_comma() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

`prophet` also provides functions for cross-validation.
```{r}
df_cv <- cross_validation(m, horizon = 30, units = 'days')

performance_metrics(df_cv) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  gather(metric, measure, -horizon) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(horizon, measure)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~metric, scales = "free_y",
             ncol = 1) +
  labs(x = "Horizon",
       y = "Measure") +
  theme_bw()
```

We can also inspect the impact of holidays on the prediction.
```{r}
df_holiday_impact <- forecast %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(ds, christmas_day:washingtons_birthday) %>% 
  select(-contains("upper"), -contains("lower")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-ds, names_to = "holiday", values_to = "value") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year(ds))) %>% 
  filter(holiday != "holidays",
         value != 0)

df_holiday_impact %>% 
  arrange(ds) %>% 
  mutate(holiday = as.factor(holiday)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(holiday, value, color = year)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_jitter() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Holiday",
       y = "Impact") +
  scale_color_discrete("Year") +
  theme_ipsum()
```
