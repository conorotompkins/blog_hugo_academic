In this post, I use k-means clustering to identify clusters of bird species based on frequency of observations per month. I use bird sightings in Allegheny County from [eBird](https://ebird.org/data/download).
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

Load the relevant libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(broom)
library(hrbrthemes)

theme_set(theme_bw())

set.seed(1234)
```

Load and filter the data:
```{r}
df <- vroom("data/ebird2/ebd_US-PA-003_201001_202003_relFeb-2020.zip", delim = "\t") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(observer_id, locality, observation_date, time_observations_started, protocol_type), str_replace_na, "NA") %>% 
  mutate(observation_count = as.numeric(str_replace(observation_count, "X", as.character(NA))),
         observation_event_id = str_c(observer_id, locality, observation_date, time_observations_started, sep = "-"),
         observation_date = ymd(observation_date)) %>%
  filter(all_species_reported == 1)
```

```{r}
df_top_protocols <- df %>% 
  count(protocol_type, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice(1:2)

df <- df %>% 
  semi_join(df_top_protocols) %>% 
  filter(year(observation_date) >= 2016)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(common_name, observation_date, observation_count) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

This graph shows general seasonality in bird observations:
```{r}
df %>% 
  count(observation_date) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observation_date, n)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Observation date",
         y = "Observation events") +
    scale_y_comma()
```

This code chunk calculates the average number of observations by species and month. Then, it interpolates a value of `0` for birds where there were no sightings in a given month:
```{r}
months <- df %>% 
  mutate(observation_month = month(observation_date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  distinct(observation_month) %>% 
  pull(observation_month)

df_seasonality <- df %>% 
  mutate(observation_month = month(observation_date, label = TRUE),
         observation_year = year(observation_date)) %>% 
  group_by(common_name, observation_year, observation_month) %>% 
  summarize(observation_count = sum(observation_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(common_name, observation_month) %>% 
  summarize(observation_count_mean = mean(observation_count) %>% round(1)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  complete(common_name, observation_month = months) %>% 
  replace_na(list(observation_count_mean = 0)) %>% 
  arrange(common_name, observation_month)

glimpse(df_seasonality)
```

This transforms the mean monthly observation into log10:
```{r}
df_seasonality <- df_seasonality %>% 
  mutate(observation_count_mean_log10 = log10(observation_count_mean),
         observation_count_mean_log10 = case_when(is.infinite(observation_count_mean_log10) ~ 0,
                                                  TRUE ~ observation_count_mean_log10)) %>% 
  select(-observation_count_mean)
```

These graphs show that observations generally increase in the spring and fall, but there is wide variation:
```{r}
df_seasonality %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observation_month, observation_count_mean_log10)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(x = "Observation month",
         y = "Mean observation count (log10)")
```

This tile graph shows the seasonality trends per species. I sort the birds by ascending mean observation count by month. It shows there are birds that appear year-round, some that appear seasonally, and some that only appear sporatically:
```{r}
vec_common_name <- df_seasonality %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = observation_month, values_from = observation_count_mean_log10, names_prefix = "month_") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  arrange(month_jan, month_feb, month_mar, month_apr, month_may, month_jun, month_jul, month_aug, month_sep, month_oct, month_nov, month_dec) %>% 
  pull(common_name)
```

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
df_seasonality %>%
  mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = vec_common_name)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(observation_month, common_name, fill = observation_count_mean_log10)) +
    geom_tile() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Mean observation count (log10)") +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    labs(x = "Observation month",
         y = "Species") +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

You can subjectively see clusters of bird types in the above graph. I will use k-means to attempt to find those clusters.

This code chunk pivots the data wide to prepare it for clustering:
```{r}
df_seasonality_wide <- df_seasonality %>% 
  select(common_name, observation_month, observation_count_mean_log10) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = observation_month, values_from = observation_count_mean_log10, names_prefix = "month_") %>% 
  clean_names()

glimpse(df_seasonality_wide)
```

This uses `purrr` to cluster the data with varying numbers of clusters (1 to 9):
```{r}
kclusts <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(
    kclust = map(k, ~kmeans(df_seasonality_wide %>% select(-common_name), .x)),
    tidied = map(kclust, tidy),
    glanced = map(kclust, glance),
    augmented = map(kclust, augment, df_seasonality_wide %>% select(-common_name))
  )

kclusts
```

```{r}
clusters <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(tidied)

assignments <- kclusts %>% 
  unnest(augmented)

clusterings <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(glanced)
```

This scree plot shows that 2 clusters is probably optimal, but 4 could also be useful:
```{r}
ggplot(clusterings, aes(k, tot.withinss)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1:9)) +
  labs(x = "Number of clusters")
```

This graph shows how the clustering performed by comparing the observation value in January to the value in the other months, for each `k` cluster value 1 through 4:
```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
assignments %>% 
  select(k, .cluster, contains("month_")) %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("month_"), names_to = "observation_month", values_to = "observation_count_mean_log10") %>% 
  mutate(month_jan = case_when(observation_month == "month_jan" ~ observation_count_mean_log10,
                               TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) %>% 
  group_by(k, .cluster, id) %>% 
  fill(month_jan, .direction = c("down")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(observation_month != "month_jan",
         k <= 4) %>% 
  mutate(k = str_c(k, "cluster(s)", sep = " ")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observation_count_mean_log10, month_jan, color = .cluster)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(k ~ observation_month) +
    labs(x = "Observation month",
         y = "January")
```

Subjectively, I think the optimal number of clusters is 4. It is noiser, but could show more interesting granularity in seasonality.

This clusters the data using 4 clusters:
```{r}
df_kmeans <- df_seasonality_wide %>% 
  select(-common_name) %>% 
  kmeans(centers = 4)
```

```{r}
df_clustered <- augment(df_kmeans, df_seasonality_wide) %>% 
  select(common_name, .cluster)

df_clustered
```

This shows the same style of tile graph as shown previously, but facets it by cluster.
```{r}
vec_common_name_cluster <- df_seasonality %>%
  left_join(df_clustered) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = observation_month, values_from = observation_count_mean_log10, names_prefix = "month_") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  arrange(cluster, month_jan, month_feb, month_mar, month_apr, month_may, month_jun, month_jul, month_aug, month_sep, month_oct, month_nov, month_dec) %>% 
  pull(common_name)
```

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
df_seasonality_clustered <-  df_seasonality %>%
  left_join(df_clustered) %>% 
  mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = vec_common_name_cluster))

df_seasonality_clustered %>% 
  mutate(.cluster = str_c("Cluster", .cluster, sep = " ")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observation_month, common_name, fill = observation_count_mean_log10)) +
    geom_tile() +
    facet_wrap(~.cluster, scales = "free_y") +
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Mean observation count (log10)") +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    labs(x = "Observation month",
         y = "Species") +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

Cluster 1 shows birds that only appear sporatically. I think these are birds that migrate through Allegheny County, but do not stick around. Cluster 2 shows birds that are generally around all year. Cluster 3 shows birds that are seen mostly during the summer, and cluster 4 contains birds that appear in the winter.

This shows a sample of each cluster:
```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
df_cluster_sample <- df_clustered %>% 
  group_by(.cluster) %>% 
  sample_n(10, replace = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup()

df_seasonality_clustered %>%
  semi_join(df_cluster_sample) %>% 
  mutate(.cluster = str_c("Cluster", .cluster, sep = " ")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observation_month, common_name, fill = observation_count_mean_log10)) +
    geom_tile() +
    facet_wrap(~.cluster, scales = "free_y") +
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Mean observation count (log10)") +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
    labs(x = "Observation month",
         y = NULL) +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```
