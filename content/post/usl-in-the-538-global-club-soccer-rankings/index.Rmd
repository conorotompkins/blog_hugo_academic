*This post was originally run with data from August 2018. 538 does not provide historical rankings, so I had to rerun the code with September 2020 data when I migrated my blog.*

538 recently added the United Soccer League to their [Soccer Power Index ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/global-club-soccer-rankings/). I'm a Riverhounds fan, so I wanted to see how the team compared to teams from leagues around the world.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

theme_set(theme_bw())
```

```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_global_rankings.csv", progress = FALSE) %>% 
  group_by(league) %>% 
  mutate(league_spi = median(spi)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(league = fct_reorder(league, league_spi))

df
```

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(spi, league)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = league), show.legend = FALSE,
              height = .2,
              alpha = .7) +
  geom_jitter(data = df %>% filter(name == "Pittsburgh Riverhounds"),
              show.legend = FALSE,
              height = .2,
              alpha = .7) +
  geom_label_repel(data = df %>% filter(name == "Pittsburgh Riverhounds"), 
                   aes(label = name), 
                   size = 3,
                   show.legend = FALSE,
                   force = 6) +
  labs(title = "538 Soccer Power Index",
       subtitle = "One dot = one team",
       y = NULL,
       x = "Soccer Power Index",
       caption = "538 data, @conor_tompkins")
```

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(spi, league)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = league), show.legend = FALSE,
              height = .2,
              alpha = .7) +
  labs(title = "538 Soccer Power Index",
       subtitle = "One dot = one team",
       y = NULL,
       x = "Soccer Power Index",
       caption = "538 data, @conor_tompkins")
```

This shows the offensive and defensive ratings of each USL team. The Riverhounds are squarely in the #LilleyBall quadrant.
```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
df %>% 
  filter(league == "United Soccer League") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(off, def, label = name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(size = 4,
                   force = 4) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(title = "538 Soccer Power Index",
       y = "Defensive rating (scale reversed)",
       x = "Offensive rating",
       caption = "538 data, @conor_tompkins")
```
