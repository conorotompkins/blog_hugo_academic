In this post I will show how to create animated graphs that illustrate the increase in buildings in Allegheny County.

One caveat about the data: it only includes parcels that were sold at some point. If the parcel was not sold, it is not included in this data. For example, a structure that was torn down and replaced **but** was not sold is not included. It is also reasonable to assume that the data quality decreases the older the records are. There may be a large amount of missing data.

The shapefiles for the parcels come from [Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1214).

The data about the construction dates comes from the [WPRDC's](http://www.wprdc.org/) [Parcels n'at](http://tools.wprdc.org/parcels-n-at/#) dashboard. To get the relevant data, draw a box around entire county, select the "Year Built" field in the Property Assessments section, and then download the data. It will take a while to download data for the entire county.

Set up the environment:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(sf)
library(scales)
library(gganimate)
library(lwgeom)

options(scipen = 999, digits = 4)

theme_set(theme_bw())

my_caption <- "@conor_tompkins - data from @WPRDC"
```

This reads in data about the land parcel (lot lines):
```{r cache = TRUE}
df <- read_csv("data/parcel_data.csv", progress = FALSE) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(-geom)
```

This reads in the parcel geometry
```{r cache = TRUE}
file <- "data/AlleghenyCounty_Parcels202008/AlleghenyCounty_Parcels202008.shp"
file
shapefile <- st_read(file)
```

Next we have to clean up the parcel geometry:
```{r}
valid_check <- shapefile %>% 
  slice(1:nrow(shapefile)) %>% 
  pull(geometry) %>% 
  map(st_is_valid) %>% 
  unlist()

shapefile$validity_check <- valid_check

shapefile <- shapefile %>% 
  filter(validity_check == TRUE)
```

```{r}
shapefile <- shapefile %>% 
  st_make_valid() %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(pin = as.character(pin))
```

Then, join the parcel geometry and parcel data:
```{r}
parcel_data <- shapefile %>% 
  left_join(df)
```

This turns the parcel geometry into `(x, y)` coordinates:
```{r}
centroids <- parcel_data %>% 
  st_centroid() %>% 
  st_coordinates() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  clean_names()
```

We can plot the coordinates to confirm that the locations make sense:
```{r}
centroids %>% 
  distinct(x, y) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(size = .1, alpha = .1) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_equal()
```

This plot shows that there is one row where `yearblt_asmt` is zero. That doesn't make sense, so we will exclude it later. 
```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yearblt_asmt)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug() +
  labs(title = "Structures in Allegheny County",
       x = "Year built",
       y = "Density",
       subtitle = my_caption)
```

This combines the `parcel_data` and `centroid` data:
```{r}
parcel_geometry_cleaned <- bind_cols(parcel_data, centroids) %>% 
  select(pin, x, y, yearblt_asmt) %>%
  mutate(yearblt_asmt = as.integer(yearblt_asmt)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(yearblt_asmt),
         yearblt_asmt > 1000) %>% 
  st_set_geometry(NULL)
```

This plots the culmulative sum of structures built:
```{r}
parcel_cumulative <- parcel_geometry_cleaned %>% 
  select(pin, yearblt_asmt) %>% 
  arrange(yearblt_asmt) %>% 
  count(yearblt_asmt) %>% 
  mutate(cumulative_n = cumsum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yearblt_asmt, cumulative_n)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(label = comma) +
    labs(title = "Cumulative sum of structures built in Allegheny County",
       x = "Year Built",
       y = "Cumulative sum",
       caption = my_caption) +
  transition_reveal(yearblt_asmt)

parcel_cumulative
```

This creates a graph of the structures built in Allegheny County, colored by the construction year.
```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
parcel_geometry_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = yearblt_asmt, group = pin)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = .1) +
  scale_color_viridis_c("Year structure was built") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Allegheny County land parcels",
       subtitle = "Year built: {frame_along}",
       caption = "@conor_tompkins, data from @WPRDC") +
  transition_reveal(yearblt_asmt)
```
